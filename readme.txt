What Is This?

This mod adds the ability to check other player's cause of death.

Simply walk up to a dead player and hold F on them to check for a cause of death.

The causes are configurable in the server-side json file (for changing the text/language).

Intallation Instructions:

Install this mod like any other mod. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys, and then once you run your server with the mod installed the mod will automatically generate the default json config file in your server profile folder under Zenarchist/ZenCauseOfDeathConfig.json.

I believe I've covered most of the vanilla causes of death but modded ones may require adding your own config.

To do that set DebugOn=1 in the config json and then kill a player (can be a dummy survivor) and hold F on it to get the "ammo" type that caused the damage included in the message.

This mod must be installed on both the server & client.

Repack & Source Code:

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.io

Enjoy!
